Merging, Editing, Converting, Extracting, Splitting; all of these activities can be done with this repository.
This is made for the purpose of aiding the people who have poor internet and have to wait 10-15 mins to just upload their files to be converted, or for people who value their data too much to share online.
Each folder has a "main.xaml" file, run it after extracting for each, and change the location accordingly, and let the magic unleash!
